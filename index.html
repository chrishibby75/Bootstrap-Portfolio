              <p>I'm going to brag about my kids.  I can't help it.  I'm so proud of them and my whole life revolves around them.  Kade and Kieran are brothers.  They're three years apart almost to the day.  Their birthdays are separated by only six days.</p>
              <p>Kieran worships his older brother.  It's fun to watch him follow Kade around and try to play with him.  They really are the best of friends.</p>
              <p>For his birthday, Grandma and Grandpa Hibberd gave Kade a bicycle.  He's learning how to ride it.  The he's starting to learn how to pedal and steer at the same time.  It's amazing the things that we take for granted, because this doesn't seem like it should be hard to do.  Kade is full of perseverance though.  He doesn't give up.</p>
